original scripts : https://github.com/jbfavre/python-zabbix/tree/master/scripts
original templates : https://github.com/jbfavre/python-zabbix/tree/master/templates

script were not modified a lot
templates however has been added a few triggers and items rules

uncompress scripts to /etc/zabbix/scripts/
uncompress zabbix-agent.conf.d to zabbix config dir: usually /etc/zabbix/zabbix-agent.conf.d/
uncompress sudoers.d content to /etc/sudoers.d/

To install the HP tools, refers to HP https://downloads.linux.hpe.com/SDR/project/mcp/, apt file is given in sources.list.d folder
Require : 
- hpasmcli (provided by hp-health)
- hpssacli (provided by hpssacli)

HP RAID script is slow, it may be required to change timeout to Timeout=10 in your zabbix agent config (/etc/zabbix/zabbix-agent.conf).

regexp must be added to http://yourzabbixserver/zabbix/adm.regexps.php (administration > general > regular expression) or discovery rules wont work (=99% of the templates)
There is however no way to export those regexp ... so you have to add them by hand
Example for :
HP Hardware Fans for discovery			regexp=^(fan)[0-9]+$				[Result is TRUE] [case sensitive=no]
HP Hardware Power for discovery			regexp=^(power)[0-9]+$				[Result is TRUE] [case sensitive=no]
HP Hardware Raid controller for discovery	regexp=^(controller)[0-9]+$			[Result is TRUE] [case sensitive=no]
HP Hardware Raid logical drive for discovery	regexp=^(logicaldrive)[0-9]+$			[Result is TRUE] [case sensitive=no]
HP Hardware Raid physical drive for discovery	regexp=^(physicaldrive)[0-9]I:[0-9]:[0-9]$	[Result is TRUE] [case sensitive=no]
HP Hardware Temperature for discovery		regexp=^(temp)[0-9]+$				[Result is TRUE] [case sensitive=no]

You can activate templates individually on your hosts, or just activate "BBC Template - HP Hardware" which is linked to the other ones
Templates are located into templates dir.

You might need to update the regexp for fan and temp to work properly in :
- hp_hard_fan.pl line 37
- hp_hard_temp.pl line 32
